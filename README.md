# Floral-Wonderland
An interactive experiment with flowers and body tracking, Floral Wonderland tracks the person’s movements by placing flowers and leaves when there is motion. The plants are a particle system, so they eventually fall due to gravity. The goal is to create a pretty, interactive experience in which the user has some control over how the plants appear and move, while keeping the movement of the plants as organic as possible to resemble real life plants.
